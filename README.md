I like play with data so I <a href="https://github.com/vonWolfehaus/von-grid">von-grid</a> and started playing with it.  But I wanted to put forms and controls around the 3D grid and populate the grid using the U.S Budget.  The goal is to create a way for people to adjust the values in the budget to say how their Tax Dollar is spent.  Demo at <a href="http://taxnvote.org">Tax N Vote</a>

This project is based on <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli">Angular-CLI</a>

This project is dedicated to all the disabled people tring to survive. I am doing this with a cohort at the VA. Shawn is good at 3D graphics. We are working together to create a 3D data display, plus a tree grid. We have some interesting ides about navigation is a 3D world. 

This project's data is supplied by <a href="http://github.com/greenpdx/TNV">Tax N Vote</a> and taxnvote.org.
